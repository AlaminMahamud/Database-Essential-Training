	you are not allowed to put a value in a Foreign key that is not exist in its table

	* Referential Integrity *

	* Cascading Delete *

	What happens when you delete all the info ? it will delete cascadingly all the rows related with one another across multiple table

	* Cascading Nulllify *

	If i delete customer then it will nullify the foreign keys of that customer

	* No Action *

	DBMS Default

	What it says ?
	--------------

	in order to create a row that is related with another table you need to create that data first

	likewise when you tend to delete the data it will refuse as it is referred with another data, So first delete referred data and then delete it.
