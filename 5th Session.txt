[5th Session - Aug - 14 - 2015]


	* Database Normalization *
	
	first Normal Form 1NF
	Second Normal Form 2NF
	Third Normal Form 3NF

	entire Point Of Normalization is to make your Database More Easier & reliable

	it helps to reduce redundancy - data is easy to get for Database Administrator & Database Designer it is a core competency

	* 1NF *

	it should have columns
	it should have tables
	it should contain just one value
	there should be no repeating value or gropus

	if we put more than one value in a field then we are violating the 1NF

	we cannot just add another additional Column like computer serial 1, computer serial 2
	it violates 1NF

	Note : it does not have any repeating values & gropus

	* Appplying Second Normal Form *

	if you want to go to 2NF then you must go from 1NF to 2NF 

	Second Normal Form:
	------------------
	Any non - key field should be dependent on the primary field key 

	Second normal form is a problem where we are using composite primary keys

	Note:
	any non-key field should be dependent on the primary key 

	*	Applying third Normal Form:  *

	3NF: 

	No non-key field is dependent on any other non-key field

	Second Normal Form asks can i figure out any of the value in this row by just one part of composite key

	Third Normal Form asks can i figure out any of the values in this row by any other values in the row. 

	Note:
	No non-key field should be dependent on another non-key field

	Normalization is all about Redundancy

	Database Denormalization:

	you are consciously making choices which could be normalized

	normalization reduces redundancy by splitting data into multiple tables causing performance hits

	Demoralization can be done to improve performance

	you must know our data before doing normalization & Denormalization  those are quality issues

	whereas doing normaliation knowingly to improve your performance is not bad 

	1NF  
	---
	no repeating values,groups

	2NF 
	---
	no non key values based on just part of a composite key

	3 NF
	----
	no non key values based on other non key values

	taking your design through these three sets of criteria will vastly qualitize your data.
